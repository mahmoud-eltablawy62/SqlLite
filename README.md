# Local Data Storage with SQLite

## Overview

This project demonstrates a simple application that uses SQLite for local data storage while offline. When the internet connection is restored, the data is seamlessly synchronized to a SQL Server database. This approach ensures data integrity and improves user experience, especially in scenarios with unstable internet connectivity.

## Features

- **Local Data Storage**: Store data locally using SQLite when the internet is unavailable.
- **Automatic Synchronization**: Automatically sync data to SQL Server when the connection is restored.
- **User-Friendly**: Users can continue to input data without interruptions, even during outages.

## Requirements

- SQLite
- SQL Server
- A development environment (Asp.net core (Mvc or Api))
